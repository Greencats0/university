# Technical Communication, A Practical Approach

## Spam mail analogy

The tech front so new, the laws are not keeping up with it.
Using old cases in irrelevant areas to settle newer cases.

## General Notes

- emails have replaced to a large extend of memo writing but the style of writing has not changed
- start up companies tend to be more chaotic and they're behavior is a direct reflection of who is running them
- Google, Facebook and other large tech companies tend to have more rigid structure and are inefficient
- the companies you work for are not only a US entity, they are multi-national global companies
	- Hankel is an example
	- Main base in Germany
	- Operations in the US, Brazil, UK and rest of Europe (to name a few)

## Types of Cultures

### High Context

- Clear distinction between insiders and outsiders
- Focus on maintaining relationships
- Dependence on internalized cultural norms

Examples include Japan, China and Arab countries

### Low Context

- Openness to outsiders
- Focus on actions and problem solving
- Willingness to disagree openly
- Dependence on formally established rules to govern behavior

Examples include Scandinavia, Germany and the US


Stick to active voice rather than passive voice

Here is the formal definition of active voice:

In grammar, an active voice is a type of a clause or sentence in which a subject performs an action and expresses it through its representative verb. To simply put it, when a subject performs an action directly, it is in active voice.

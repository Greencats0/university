# GEO Lab Notes: Rock Cycle

Order for rock to enter cycle does not matter

## Igneous (Initial Creation)

- Lava - on the Earth's surface
- Magma - under the Earth's surface

![magma vs lava](assets/magma_vs_lava)

- \underline{Extrusive:} cools on the Earth's surface
- \underline{Intrusive:} cools under the Earth's surface


\newpage

## Sedimentary (Deposition)

- \underline{Clastic:} formed by mechanical weathering patterns (chunks of old rock in new rock)
- \underline{Chemical:} formed when dissolved materials precipitate from solution
- \underline{Biogenic:} formed by organic material

## Metamorphic Rocks (Change)

Has been changed by heat, pressure and chemical

\underline{Foliated:} layered or banded appearance (from heat and direct pressure)
\underline{Nonfoliated:} from the accumulation of organic material

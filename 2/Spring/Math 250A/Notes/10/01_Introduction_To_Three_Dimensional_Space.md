# Introduction to 3D Space

We can associate a point "P" with 3 coordinates (X_{o}, Y_{o}, Z_{o}) and is unique with such coordinates.

## Example


$$ B \rightarrow (x_{o}, y_{o}) $$
$$ C \rightarrow (x_{1}, y_{1}) $$

_{}

- By the Pythagorean Theorem: $$ | BC | = \sqrt{(x_{1}-x_{0})^2+(y_{1-y_{0}}^2)} $$
- Our distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem
- The distance from the origin will be associated in the coordinates

## Example 1

$$ P(-1, 0, 5) $$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
x = -1 \\
y = 0\\
z = 5
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}

# 3D Distance Formula

- Find the distance &rarr; $$ d((x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}), (x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})) $$
- In $ \bigtriangleup ABC $ by the Pythagorean Theorem:

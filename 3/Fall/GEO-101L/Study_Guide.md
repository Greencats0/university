## General Questions
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the definition of a mineral? Provide an example:
	\subitem {\color{red} Naturally occuring, inorganic, solids, distinct chemical composition, crystalline structure. Ice is an example.}
\item \underline{Define:}
	\subitem {\color{red} Luster: how it shines}
	\subitem {\color{red} Cleavage: Planes in which the rock/mineral break}
	\subitem {\color{red} Fracture: \hl{yeah I don't know}}
	\subitem {\color{red} Hardness: how strong are the chemical bonds in the mineral.}
	\subitem {\color{red} Streak: the color it leaves when scraped on porcelain.}
\item What mineral effervesces when HCl (Hydrochloric Acid) is dropped on it?:
	\subitem {\color{red} Calcite}
\item \textbf{\underline{Igneous Rocks}}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Define:} Rocks that have completely melted}
	\subitem {\color{red} {Aphanitic texture:} cannot see individual minerals}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Phaneritic texture:} Coarse grained texture}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Porphyritic texture:} Fine-grained texture}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{What 3 criteria are used to identify igneous rocks?}}
		\subsubitem{\color{red} Texture}
		\subsubitem{\color{red} Composition}
		\subsubitem{\color{red} Mineralology}
\item What is a divergent plate boundary and how does it relate to igneous rock?
	\subitem {\color{red} Two plates move apart and lava comes up from the cracks that form.}
\item What is a convergent plate boundary and how does it relate to igneous rocks?
	\subitem {\color{red} Two plates going head on with one another and if one is lighter than the other it can get trapped underneath the dominant plate. This subduction results in the melting of the submissive plate, creating new igneous rock.}
\item \underline{Intrusive:}
	\subitem {\color{red} Cooled inside the Earth}
\item \underline{Extrusive:}
	\subitem {\color{red} Cooled on Earth's surface}
\item \underline{\textbf{Sedimentary Rocks}}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{How are sedimentary rocks formed:} Rocks and sediments layered ontop of each other.}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Three types of sedimentary rocks:}}
		\subsubitem Clastic
		\subsubitem Chemical
		\subsubitem Biogenic
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{How are clastic sedimentary rocks commonly classified?:} Their grain size, mineralogy, grain/mineral shape and sorting.}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{What are the three clast particle size and classifications:} Gravel, sand, mud.}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{How would you tell the difference between chalk and diatomite?:} Diatomite is made of diatoms which have a Silica skeleton. Chalk is made of cocolithophores whuch have a calcite skeletons. Since we know that calcite will react with HCl, we can test by checking for fizz on both samples.}
\item \underline{\textbf{Metamorphic Rocks}}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{How do metamorphic rocks form?:} High heat and/or pressure. Any combination of the two.}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{The type of metamorphic rock that forms is dependent on which three factors?:} Parent rock, temperature, and pressure.}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Define regional metamorphism} $\uparrow$ pressure, $\downarrow$ temperature}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Defined contact metamorphism:} Hot magma burns but does not completely melt surrounding rock.}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Define foliated texture:} Banded appearence}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{Shale is the parent rock of which four metamorphic rocks?:} Slate, schist, gneiss, phyllite}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{What is the parent rock of quartzite?:} Sandstone}
	\subitem {\color{red} \underline{What is the parent rock of marble?:} Limestone}

# Investigating Geologic Questions

## Things to look out for

- Observe the Mediterranean Sea, noting how it connects (or does not connect)
	- Human intervention
	- Plate tectonics allow for water to flow
- Draw what you see
- Different scales (perspectives) are different ways of viewing a scene
	- Earth from space vs microscope
- Compare this rock to deposits from two environments shown below
	- Which environment has deposits most similar to the rock
- uniformitarianism (rocks are being moved now and it can be assumed that they moved in the past)


## Interpreting Evolution of Landscapes

- rain, wind, erosion etc

Mesa -> Butte -> Knobs


## Determining Sequences of Events: Position of Layers

The bottom most layer is the oldest in the stack

- This is true for Geology

## Cross-Cutting Relations

Faults, fractures and cracks can only occur if the layers existed first

## Pieces of clast

Older rock that is trapped inside newer rock

## Contact Effects

Hot molten rock burns cooler surrounding rock. This is called the "Baked Zone"

**Rock layers can be different**

## Types of Maps

- Shaded-relief map
- Topographic map with elevation contours


## Referring to Differences in Topography

- gradient


## Depicting Series of Events 


## Qualitative vs Quantitative

- Qualitative : descriptions
- Quantitative : numeric measurements (conveyed with numbers)

## Density

- Mass/Volume

## Weight

- Downward force an object exerts via gravity

W = mg

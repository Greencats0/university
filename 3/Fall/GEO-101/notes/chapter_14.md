# Characteristics of a Glacier

- slow moving river
- moves rocks
- erosion and transport
- works its way down
- can merge together
- does not have to be in the mountains but has to be really cold and enough precipitation

## Glaciers in the Landscape

- cracks (crevasses) due to flow
- lower parts typically blue ice
- Fed by ice sheets or snowfields
- carry rocks, especially along margins

## Types of Glaciers

### Valley

- carve out and reshape the landscape

### Ice Sheet

Dunno what to put here

### Piedmont

- sit on top of the mountain

## Locations

- Antartica
- New Zealand
- Iceland

## How snow accumulate

- since the material does not melt, there is contiually compacted with layers upon layers
- glaciers form where accumulatation of snow and ice exceeds loss
- glaciers lose ice and snow by melting, wind erosion and sublimation
- equlibrium line:  that divides the zone of ablation from the accumulation zone
- always dragging down the valley
    - cycle repeats itself

## Glacier Erosion

- Carries rock and other debris that can erodes underlying materials
- abrade and smooth off bedrock in the way
- pluck rocks from down-flow side
- striations (direction of movement of the glacier)

## Deposits of Glacial Origins

- Moraine (large pile of dirt, bulldozer went through and went home)
- Outwash
- Till (big clay ridge)
- Glacialfluvial Deposits

## Features Formed by Glacial Erosion

- Cirques
- Aretes
- U-Shaped Valley
- Fjord (tied to oceans)
- Hanging Valley

## Landscape Features of Continental Ice Sheets

- Kettle lakes (stick ice in a sand hole and cover it. What do you end up with?)
- Esker (river like)
- Drumlins

*add graphic here*

## Axis of Rotation

- More tilt: $\phi = 24.5$
- Present tilt: $\phi = 25$

# Shorelines

- Where water meets land
- Less water in the glaciers, more water in the ocean

## Characteristics 

- Low tide
- High tide
- Waves
- Wind

## What are tides

- Pull of the moon
- there is a bulge when being pulled by the moon
- California has four tides and Florida has two

## Waves

- response of energy going through the water
- not going anywhere
- wave base = $\frac{\Delta crest}{2} = \frac{crest\textsubscript{f} - crest\textsubscript{i}}{2}$

Winter time beaches are not flat and steep (plunging)

Summer time beaches are mostly flat because there are not as many storms (spilling)

### Waves interacting with the shoreline

- main cause of erosion on the shorelines
- Swirl away loose pieces of bedrock or break off new pieces 
- Grind and break clasts, making sand and stones that promote erosion
- Waves bend (refract) if approaching shoreline at an angle $\theta$
    - part that encounters the bottom slows, bending waves
- Waves break directly on promontory from several sides
- Bays may be protected from most waves

### Hazards along Shorelines

- Waves
- Storm surge
- Strong winds

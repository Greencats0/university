%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Edgar, I would like to talk to discuss the proposed plan to migrate operations to the United Kingdom. 
Seeing that the last project here in the States went well, I do not see this taking more than three months.
However this does raise concern for housing and cost of living for more than just me.
As you know, I am married and it would put a strain on my relationship with my wife.
Would it be in the budget to accomodate another person or would there need to be a compromise?

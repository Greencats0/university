# Technical Communication in the Workplace

Different branches of communication.

## Academic Communication

- show that you know your stuff
- not smarter than a teacher but still apt (audience is the professor/teacher -> one person/entity)
- analysis of material
- examples : essays, exams, and papers

## Technical Communication

- do something
- you are guiding the read because you know more than they do
- there are multiple different people reading your material that may have less or more knowledge than you do
- great video example conveying this : [Explaining Quantum Physics to a 5 Year Old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWJCfOvochA)
- you need be as concise as possible. For example, manuals are written so anyone can assemble the product. They do not need to know the engineering specifics in an exhaustive extent
- examples : in-house correspondence (emails via colleagues and memos from the engineering department), short/long reports, proposals and websites.
- audience : many people

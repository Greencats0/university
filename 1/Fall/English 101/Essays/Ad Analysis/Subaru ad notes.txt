The use of the dog in the ad is a practical technique to convey time progression as at the start of the ad it is a puppy and later a full grown dog with a grey muzzle. We the viewers are immediately drawn to the sight of a puppy happily accompanying his companion gather his belongings. The use of this dog is important as it is something from the boy’s past that he can say goodbye to directly, much like his parents or home. It also taps into our common animal loving side, seeing a puppy will automatically draw you into the scene. Rather, if the dog happened to be a lizard or snake, we the viewers would not be so inclined to finish watching the ad.

On the surface, the ad does not seem to have a negative and repressive attitude. Once one starts to delve deeper into how the ad is structured, however, the viewer can uncover the hidden message. An important component of the advertisement, the ethos, can be found in a line said by the main character as he sadly remarks “I have to go” to his companion. This comment made so innocently paints a bigger picture at hand; the American tradition of carting one’s little angel to University. It is so ingrained into our culture that once an opinion has now been formed into what our society deems as a fact and necessity. This ideology has been seeded into the boy and can be seen through the strong will of the child and his desire to leave. It is not rooted in malicious intent but as a mark of maturity deemed by the American psyche. There seems to be a hint of hesitancy made by the young boy when he’s about to put the last of his belongings into the trunk of his car.

The advertisement would falter perhaps if there was no progression of age conveyed through the boy. It is crucial that we see the boy at a much younger age because we immediately form a connection with the main character. Humans are drawn to the young children because we can relate to them as we have all gone through this part of our lives. In using pathos and ethos, the ad sets us up emotionally to receive the message and product they wish to convey.

# Notes

- According to the Math/Science Elective requirements, it says I don't have to take PHYS-225 again as I would have already met the unit requirements. That being said, how does that affect my standings in regards to getting into the CSUF Master's Program? Would it hinder or make it harder to get into the program or would it be negligible?
	- Would it not hurt to take this class over again, just to absolve the grade since I am already enrolled in the class?

### Scalars

${\rm I\!R}$ that dictates how to stretch or scale a vector. Think slope.

Examples of scalars: temperature, pressure, and density

Scalar field: one number is associated with each $(x, y, z, t)$ point in ${\rm I\!R}$\textsuperscript{4}

### Vectors

![Vector Example](assets/vector){width=50%}

A quantity that holds both magnitude and direction.

In ${\rm I\!R}$\textsuperscript{3}, each have 3 ${\rm I\!R}$ associated with each point. 

\underline{Example:} velocity field of flow $\vec{V}(x,y,z,t)$, gas/fluid flow, E&M Fields

RECURSION
---------

functions that might be on the EPP
----------------------------------

count negative
count positive
count zeros
count non zeros
count evens
count odds
sum
multiply
division

^ DONE ALL THESE
max
min


IMPLEMENT WITH LAMBDA to make your life easier

two functions must be written
-----------------------------

write predicate functions. predicate abstracts the pattern. (handles program logic)
recursion handles the arithmetic functionality of the program


NOTES
=====

1. Add these files to Github as a backup
2. Write a README.md under the data structure directory as a checklist for functions needed along with other helpful methods
3. Some challange examples?



Writing data structures from scratch
------------------------------------

Vector (array implementation)
Linked List (raw pointers)
Stacks
Queues

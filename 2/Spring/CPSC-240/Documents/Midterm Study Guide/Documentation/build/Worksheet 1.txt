Basic Concepts Worksheet #1: Basic Concepts

True-False

1. The binary representation of decimal 42 is 00101010.
	- True
	
2. The hexadecimal representation of decimal 35 is 33h
	- False. It is 0x35 or 35h

3. The sum of the binary integers 01101101 and 00111011 is 10101001.
	- False. It is 010101000

4. The 8-bit two's complement of binary 00000010 is 11111110.
	- True. Invert bits, then add one

5. The binary representation of decimal -42 is 11010111.
	- False. It is -0b101010

6. Suppose there is a virtual machine containing levels V1 and V2, where V2 is above V1 in the machine
hierarchy. The programs written in language V2 can be executed by a program running at level V1.
	- False. There is no interpreter for the V2 language so it cannot be run. It is a higher level language, much like C to assembler.

7. The sum of all powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^8 is 511.
	- True

8. A virtual machine may be constructed from software.
	-  True. VMWare, virtualbox, etc.
9. The sum of 3AB4h and 0429h is 3EDDh.
	- True
10. To translate an unsigned decimal integer into binary, repeatedly divide the integer by 2, saving each
remainder as a binary digit.
	- True. This also works for reversing the number. For example, you give the program 54 and it prints 45.
11. The expression !X && !Y is false when X is false and Y is true.
	- True

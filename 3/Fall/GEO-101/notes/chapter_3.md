# Chapter 3 : Plate Tectonics
,
There are many plate boundaries and they have unique characteristics

## Fossil Data and Continental Drift

- similar animals at boundaries between continents
- continents were all together at one time
- WW2 changed our perspective
- map where all the earthquakes happen, where all of the volcanoes were
- mountains in the belts


## Three Types of Relative Plate Motions

### Moving apart: divergent boundary (Atlantic ocean)
	- magma is coming up from the bottom to fill the gap
	- 
### Moving toward each other : Convergent Boundary
	- same density
	- the plate begins to melt at some depth and forms a chain of islands
- move horizontally past one another: transform boundary (san andres fault)
	- zig-zag pattern and is not a linear path for the fault

## What moves the Plates

We are not sure what the root cause of the movement is

SUBJECT: Calgary Assignment

\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

Moving forward with the project of the assignment in Calgary as defined by scouting the location and reporting on costs for what that entails. 
In taking this position, I look forward to the additional responsibilities and new learning experiences.
With that being said, I wanted to bring to your attention to some concerns I do have found in regards to this assignment.

The following are listed below:

1. The building needs to be refurbished, it is not up to code. Also it needs to be rewired for proper internet and phone lines.
2. There is still a need to hire employees for this location. Is there any word of hiring a recruiting manager or will this be handled directly through Human Resources?
3. For pay will it be competitive to compete with Company B as well? This goes for both new hires and transfers like myself.
4. Is there going to be transportation reimbursement for those who live outside of Calgary?
5. What is the expected timeline of operations upon final completion?

According to my calculations, it would cost around $20,000 for removal of dial-up cables and rewiring of a building of this size.
Our new location has a size of 16,300 square feet and is centrally located in the heart of Calgary.
This office space has a dedicated parking garage that can support the estimated 250 people required to run this location.
Total number of spots is 350 which is an added buffer if we do in fact need to hire more individuals in the future.

Since we are in direct competition with Company B, we need to offer competitive salaries.
The average salary for computer programmers, which is the field with most demand, is around $55,000.
This means we need to increase our base rate for junior and mid-level programming positions to $60,000 and offer weekly luncheons.

In regards to my salary, I am currently making $45,000

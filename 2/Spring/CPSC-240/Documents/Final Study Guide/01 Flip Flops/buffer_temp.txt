The D-Type Flip-flop changed state when it was rising clock edge. You can use a JK flip flop to make a T flip flop because they are essentially the same circuit design where a T flip flop has two inputs rather than one. According to the documentation provided by Fairchild, it is possible for one to make a 8 bit binary counter but if asked to on the spot, I personally cannot.+++/home/jared/Documents/School/CompSci-CSUF/CPSC-240/Documents/Final Study Guide/01 Flip Flops/+++

# Flip Flops

The purpose of a flip flop is to preserve the data over a duration of time. Ones that are clocked will ignore all of the inputs given until the clock is signaled. 

## Clocks

- Rising Edge: the transition from low to high
- Falling Edge: the transition from high to low

## Caveat

There is a problem called **metastability** which is when the clock and data line are changed at around the same time, the hardware has a hard time telling which one came first, so there may be undefined behavior that would incur.

## D Flip Flop

- When E is high (1), Q follows D with Q' the complement of Q
- When E is low (0), the output remains the same (no state change) and D is ignored

- E: Enable
- D: Data
- Q Q' : Output

## D Flip Flop (Clocked)

- Captures the value of the D input at a specific portion of the clock cycle (rising or falling edge)
- **Clock Cycle**: the clock line going high and then low again

## SR Flip Flop

- When both S and R are low, the outputs are in a constant state
- Q and Q' are complementary; when Q is high, Q' is low

## JK Flip Flop

- All state changes are synced to a clock point
	- When J is 1 and K is 0, on the next clock rising edge, Q will go high
	- When K is 1 and J is 0, on the next clock rising edge Q will go low
	- When J and K are both 0, nothing will happen when the clock is pulsed
	- If J and K are 1, no matter the state of Q, it will change to the opposite state (flipping)

## T Flip Flop

- When T is high, every clock cycle will toggle the outputs

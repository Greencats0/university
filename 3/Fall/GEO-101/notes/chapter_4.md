- Inorganic
- Ordered internal structure
- Specific chemical composition

![Examples of minerals](assets/minerals){width=50%}

## Is ice a mineral

Ice by definition it is a mineral (when solid) but as a liquid is not.

## Mineral formation in other rocks

Composed of visible or microscopic crystals: \hl{crystalline rock}

![Crystalline Rocks](assets/crystalline){width=50%}

Composed of pieces (clasts): \hl{clastic rocks}

## Distinguishing One Mineral from Another

### Crystal formation

### Cleavage

- How it shears along smooth planes parallel to the zones of weak bonding.
- Sheets joined by long bonds between sheets break along the weakest bonds
- Bonds with the same strength can break along `N` sets of planes  without passing through an atom
- In other arrangements, the mineral will break in nearly any direction so it will fracture instead of cleave.

### Color

### Luster

How much it reflects in the light

### Hardness

How strong the bonds are between the atoms

### Effervescence 

The foaming and fizzing reaction when certain chemicals come in contact with it

### Streak

What color does it leave behind if scraped on a porcelain plate

### Magnetism 

Does it attract magnets

### Density

\newpage

## What controls a crystal's shape

- Sizes and packing of atoms
- Internal structure of the mineral
- orderly arrangement of atoms in repeating patterns

### Different shapes
- Cube
- Tetrahedron
- Octahedron

## Major Classes of Rock-Forming Minerals

### Silicate Minerals

![Silicate Tetrahedron](assets/silicate_tet){width=50%}

Can bond together and with other elements

#### Independent Tetrahedra

Tetrahedra bond to other elements, not other tetrahedra

\newpage

#### Single Chain

![Pyroxene](assets/pyroxene){width=30%}

#### Double Chain

![Amphibole](assets/amphibole){width=30%}


\newpage

#### Sheet Silicate

![Mica](assets/mica){width=50%}

#### Frameworks

![Quartz](assets/quartz){width=50%}

\newpage

### Nonsilicate Minerals

#### Carbonates

![Calcite](assets/calcite){width=50%}

#### Oxides

![Magnetite](assets/magnetite){width=50%}

\newpage

#### Sulfides

![Pyrite](assets/pyrite){width=40%}


#### Halides

## How Atoms Bond

### Sharing

Covalent bond

Example: water

### Loaning

Ionic bond

Example: salt

### Free flow

Metallic bond

Example: copper

### Stick together

Intermolecular bonds

Example: Oxygen and Hydrogen bond

## Crystal Structure and Bonds

- Carbon makes up both graphite and diamonds
- The only difference between the two is the bonds that make up the substance
- Diamonds have an extremely strong network of bonds

## Properties of Water

- Oxygen and hydrogen share electron
- Water molecules are polar
- Helps dissolve other compounds

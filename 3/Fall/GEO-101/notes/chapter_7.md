# Sedimentary Environments

![Rocks have layers too](assets/sedimentary_mem){width=50%}

Exam will be 50-54 questions and the test is out of 100 points

Extra questions are delegated for extra credit

\newpage

## Formation

They form at a low place
- Depositional environment

![Sedimentary rock formation diagram](assets/sedimentary_formation){width=50%}

### Places

- Mountains
- Steep streams
- Sand dunes
- Slow moving rivers (Mississippi River)
- Deltas, wetlands (places where coal forms)
- Lakes
- Beaches
- Reefs
- Lagoons
- Beach dunes
- Tidal flats

\newpage

## Physical Weathering

- Fracturing and crack rocks
- Frost and mineral weathering 
	- (Ice expands when it freezes)
	- Sugar at the bottom of tea when there is too much sugar to be in solution
- Thermal expansion
- Roots and other biological activity

## Chemical Weathering

- Dissolution
	- Water is slightly acidic (anything with pH of 7 and below)
- Hydrolysis
	- the chemical breakdown of a compound due to reaction with water
- Oxidation
- Biological reactions
	- Plants will poison other plants to prevent them to get their resources
	- Animals will dig and dig

\newpage

## Clast Sizes

- Boulders, cobbles, pebbles

### Shape

- Rounder == more distance traveled
- Angular == freshly broken

### Sorted

- Poorly sorted (fairly grade)
	- assorted sizes of clast
- Moderately sorted (moderate)
	- mostly the same size of clast
- Well sorted (poorly graded)
	- nearly all the same size

### Controls on size, shape, and sorting

- Steepness of slope
- Strength of current
- Agent of transport

### Common Clastic Sedimentary Rocks

- Conglomerate (Coarsest)
- Breccia
- Sandstone
- Shale (Finest)

### How Clastic Sediments Becomes rock

- Compaction (Stuff on top of it)
- Cementation (Sand + Lime = Cement)

### Rocks Formed by Chemical Reactions

- Setting $\rightarrow$ Rock salt
- Setting $\rightarrow$ Travertine (limestone)
- Setting (Coral reef) $\rightarrow$ Limestone with fossils
- Setting (Plant matter) $\rightarrow$ COal

### Other nonclastic sedimentary rocks

- Gypsum
- Chalk
- Dolostone
- Chert

### Types of bedding

- Parallel bedding

![Parallel Bedding Example](assets/parallel_bedding){width=50%}

- Cross bedding
- Graded bedding
